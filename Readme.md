Sublime Text 2 Clojure support
==============================
Found a collection of Clojure code snippets and formatted them for Sublime Text 2!    
Source: https://github.com/swannodette/clojure-snippets

Fixed and updated snippets according to: https://github.com/ljos/clojure-snippets       
    
Added a Leining build file!  
Source: https://gist.github.com/4103540  
(Changed "working_dir" from $project_path too $file)


V2.0:
=====
* Removed snippets and made one .sublime-completions
* Added tons of symbols without actuall snippet content
* Added tons of libs

Practical notes:
If you push a new snippet, make sure its removed from the symbol list!
